# BarsStallone Support Resistance Indicator

This code is a custom indicator for the MetaTrader 4 (MT4) trading platform. It calculates and displays support and resistance levels on the chart based on the high and low prices of the specified period.

## How it works

The indicator uses the following inputs:

- `period`: The number of bars used to calculate the support and resistance levels. The default value is 14.

The indicator has two buffers:

- `SupportBuffer`: Stores the calculated support levels.
- `ResistanceBuffer`: Stores the calculated resistance levels.

The initialization function (`OnInit()`) sets the indicator buffers and labels. It sets `SupportBuffer` as the first buffer and `ResistanceBuffer` as the second buffer. It also sets the indicator name and labels for the support and resistance levels.

The calculation function (`OnCalculate()`) is called each time a new price bar is formed. It calculates the support and resistance levels using the high and low prices of the specified period.

The calculation is done by iterating through the bars and finding the highest high and lowest low within the specified period. The support level is set as the lowest low, and the resistance level is set as the highest high. The calculated levels are stored in the indicator buffers.
